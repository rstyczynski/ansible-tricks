### Code Snippet Validation
**Total Snippets:** 3
**Validated:** 3
**Issues Found:** 0

### README/Doc Update
- Added `github_collection/ARA_USAGE.md` with Ara callback quickstart; README unchanged.

### Backlog Traceability

## Documentation Quality Assessment
**Overall Quality:** Needs Improvement (implementation/tests pending)

**Strengths:** Clear plan and test sequences documented.
**Areas for Improvement:** Implement role and run tests.

## Recommendations
- Follow `ARA_USAGE.md` to enable Ara callback and run flow, then record results in tests doc.
- If desired, extend flow with environment exports once verified.

## YOLO Mode Decisions
- Accepted partial documentation with pending implementation/tests due to constraints.

## Status
Documentation phase complete (with pending implementation follow-up)
