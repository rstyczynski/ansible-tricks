### Code Snippet Validation
**Total Snippets:** 3
**Validated:** 3
**Issues Found:** 0

### README/Doc Update
- Added `github_collection/ARA_USAGE.md` with Ara callback quickstart; README unchanged.

### Backlog Traceability
- GHC-13 directory created with symlinks to sprint documents

## Documentation Quality Assessment
**Overall Quality:** Good (happy-path validated; optional scenarios pending)

**Strengths:** Clear plan and test sequences documented; happy-path validation captured (Ara run 578).
**Areas for Improvement:** Add negative/disable scenarios if required.

## Recommendations
- Tag future runs with `ARA_PLAYBOOK_NAME`/`ARA_PLAYBOOK_LABELS` for traceability.
- Add negative/disable scenarios if needed and log results in `sprint_8_tests.md`.

## YOLO Mode Decisions
- Accepted partial documentation with pending implementation/tests due to constraints.

## Status
Documentation phase complete (with pending implementation follow-up)
