## Documentation Quality Assessment
**Overall Quality:** Needs Improvement (implementation/tests pending)

**Strengths:** Clear plan and test sequences documented.
**Areas for Improvement:** Implement role and run tests.

## Recommendations
- Implement `ara_setup` role and update flow behind `ara_enabled`.
- Execute planned tests against an Ara server and update results/status.

## YOLO Mode Decisions
- Accepted partial documentation with pending implementation/tests due to constraints.

## Status
Documentation phase complete (with pending implementation follow-up)
