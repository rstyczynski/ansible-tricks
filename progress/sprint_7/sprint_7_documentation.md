## Documentation Quality Assessment

**Overall Quality:** Good

**Strengths:**
- New role documented with clear inputs/outputs and usage.
- Flow integration and approval logic described.

**Areas for Improvement:**
- Functional tests pending execution; update results after live run.

## Recommendations
- Execute documented tests against a real PR to validate barrier behavior and update results/statuses accordingly.
- Adjust default comment/patterns if manual approval is preferred over auto-approval.

## YOLO Mode Decisions
This sprint documentation was completed in YOLO (autonomous) mode. The following decisions were made:

### Decision 1: Accept pending test execution
**Context:** No live GitHub run available during documentation.
**Decision Made:** Mark tests as pending but proceed with documentation updates.
**Rationale:** Aligns with YOLO guidance to proceed with partial success while logging gaps.
**Risk:** Medium – real-world issues may surface once tests run.

## Status
Documentation phase complete
