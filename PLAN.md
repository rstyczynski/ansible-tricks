# Development plan

Project details are in `plan.md` file.

Instruction for operator: keep the development sprint by sprint by changing `Status` label form Planned via Progress to Planned. To achieve simplicity each iteration contains exactly one feature. YOu may add more backlog Items in `BACKLOG.md` file, refereeing them in this plan.
